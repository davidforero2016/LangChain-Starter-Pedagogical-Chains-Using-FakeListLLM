# LangChain using FakeListLLM
#This repository introduces the logic and structure behind basic LLM chains using LangChain, a widely adopted framework for building applications powered by language models. Instead of connecting to a paid API, we use FakeListLLM — a simulated language model — to explore the building blocks of prompts, chains, and responses in a fully local, cost-free environment.
